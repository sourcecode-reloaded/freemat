<H3>Usage</H3>
Converts a sparse matrix to a full matrix.  The syntax for
its use is
<PRE>
   y = full(x)
</PRE>
<P>
The type of <code>x</code> is preserved.  Be careful with the function.
As a general rule of thumb, if you can work with the <code>full</code>
representation of a function, you probably do not need the
sparse representation.
<H3>Example</H3>
Here we convert a full matrix to a sparse one, and back again.
