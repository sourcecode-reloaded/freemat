Section: <A HREF=sec_io.html> Input/Ouput Functions </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
Write the image data from the matrix into a given file.  Note that
FreeMat's support for <code>imwrite</code> is not complete.
You can write images in the <code>jpg,png,xpm,ppm</code> and some other formats.
The syntax for its use is
<PRE>
  imwrite(filename, A)
  imwrite(filename, A, map)
  imwrite(filename, A, map, alpha)
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>filename</code> is the name of the file to write to.  The input array 
<code>A</code> contains the image data (2D for gray or indexed, and 3D for color).  
If <code>A</code> is an integer array (int8, uint8, int16, uint16, int32, uint32), 
the values of its elements should be within 0-255.  If <code>A</code> is a 
floating-point array (float or double), the value of its elements should be 
within 0-1.  <code>map</code> contains the colormap information (for indexed images),
and <code>alpha</code> the alphamap (transparency).
