<H2>UINT32 Convert to Unsigned 32-bit Integer
</H2>
<P>
Section: <A HREF=sec_typecast.html> Type Conversion Functions </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
Converts the argument to an unsigned 32-bit Integer.  The syntax
for its use is
<PRE>
   y = uint32(x)
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>x</code> is an <code>n</code>-dimensional numerical array.  Conversion
follows saturation rules (e.g., if <code>x</code> is outside the normal
range for an unsigned 32-bit integer of <code>[0,4294967295]</code>, it is
truncated to that range. Note that both <code>NaN</code> and <code>Inf</code> both map to 0.
<H3>Example</H3>
The following piece of code demonstrates several uses of <code>uint32</code>.
@&gt;
In the next example, an integer outside the range of the type is passed in.  
The result is truncated to the maximum value of the data type.
@&gt;
In the next example, a negative integer is passed in.  The result is 
truncated to zero.
@&gt;
In the next example, a positive double precision argument is passed in.  
The result is the unsigned integer that is closest to the argument.
@&gt;
In the next example, a complex argument is passed in.  The result is the 
complex unsigned integer that is closest to the argument.
@&gt;
In the next example, a string argument is passed in.  The string argument 
is converted into an integer array corresponding to the ASCII values of each character.
@&gt;
In the last example, a cell-array is passed in.  For cell-arrays and 
structure arrays, the result is an error.
