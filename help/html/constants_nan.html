<H2>NAN Not-a-Number Constant
</H2>
<P>
Section: <A HREF=sec_constants.html> Base Constants </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
Returns a value that represents ``not-a-number'' for both 32 and 64-bit 
floating point values.  This constant is meant to represent the result of
arithmetic operations whose output cannot be meaningfully defined (like 
zero divided by zero).
<PRE>
   y = nan
</PRE>
<P>
The returned type is a 64-bit float, but demotion to 32 bits preserves the not-a-number.  The not-a-number constant has one simple property.  In particular, any arithmetic operation with a <code>NaN</code> results in a <code>NaN</code>. These calculations run significantly slower than calculations involving finite quantities!  Make sure that you use <code>NaN</code>s in extreme circumstances only.  Note that <code>NaN</code> is not preserved under type conversion to integer types (see the examples below).
<H3>Example</H3>
The following examples demonstrate a few calculations with the not-a-number constant.
<PRE>
--&gt; nan*0

ans = 

       nan 

--&gt; nan-nan

ans = 

       nan 
</PRE>
<P>
Note that <code>NaN</code>s are preserved under type conversion to floating point types (i.e., <code>float</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>complex</code> and <code>dcomplex</code> types), but not integer  types.
<PRE>
--&gt; uint32(nan)

ans = 

 0 

--&gt; complex(nan)

ans = 

       nan
