Section: <A HREF=sec_curvefit.html> Optimization and Curve Fitting </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
This function calculates the polynomial coefficients for given roots
<PRE>
    p = poly(r)
</PRE>
<P>
when <code>r</code> is a vector, is a vector whose elements are the coefficients 
of the polynomial whose roots are the elements of <code>r</code>.  Alternately,
you can provide a matrix
<PRE>
    p = poly(A)
</PRE>
<P>
when <code>A</code> is an <code>N x N</code> square matrix, is a row vector with 
<code>N+1</code> elements which are the coefficients of the
characteristic polynomial, <code>det(lambda*eye(size(A))-A)</code>.
