<H3>USAGE</H3>
Compares two strings for equality, but only looks at the
first N characters from each string.  The general syntax 
for its use is
<PRE>
  p = strncmp(x,y,n)
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are two strings.  Returns <code>true</code> if <code>x</code>
and <code>y</code> are each at least <code>n</code> characters long, and if the
first <code>n</code> characters from each string are the same.  Otherwise,
it returns <code>false</code>.
In the second form, <code>strncmp</code> can be applied to a cell array of
strings.  The syntax for this form is
<PRE>
  p = strncmp(cellstra,cellstrb,n)
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>cellstra</code> and <code>cellstrb</code> are cell arrays of a strings
to compare.  Also, you can also supply a character matrix as
an argument to <code>strcmp</code>, in which case it will be converted
via <code>cellstr</code> (so that trailing spaces are removed), before being
compared.
<H3>Example</H3>
The following piece of code compares two strings:

Here we use a cell array strings
@&gt;
Here we compare two cell arrays of strings
@&gt;
Finally, the case where one of the arguments is a matrix
