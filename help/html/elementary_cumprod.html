Section: <A HREF=sec_elementary.html> Elementary Functions </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
Computes the cumulative product of an n-dimensional array along a given
dimension.  The general syntax for its use is
<PRE>
  y = cumprod(x,d)
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>x</code> is a multidimensional array of numerical type, and <code>d</code>
is the dimension along which to perform the cumulative product.  The
output <code>y</code> is the same size of <code>x</code>.  Integer types are promoted
to <code>int32</code>. If the dimension <code>d</code> is not specified, then the
cumulative sum is applied along the first non-singular dimension.

<H3>Example</H3>
The default action is to perform the cumulative product along the
first non-singular dimension.
