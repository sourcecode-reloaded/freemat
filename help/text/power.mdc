POWER POWER Overloaded Power Operator

Usage

This is a method that is invoked when one variable is raised
to another variable using the dot-power operator, and is
invoked when you call

   c = power(a,b)

or

   c = a.^b

POWER POWER Matrix Power Operator

Usage

The power operator for scalars and square matrices.  This operator is really a 
combination of two operators, both of which have the same general syntax:

  y = a ^ b

The exact action taken by this operator, and the size and type of the output, 
depends on which of the two configurations of a and b is present:
  1.  a is a scalar, b is a square matrix

  2.  a is a square matrix, b is a scalar
