\section{UNIQUE Unique}

\subsection{Usage}

Returns a vector containing the unique elements of an array.  The first
form is simply
\begin{verbatim}
   y = unique(x)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|x| is either a numerical array or a cell-array of strings.  The 
result is sorted in increasing order.  You can also retrieve two sets
of index vectors
\begin{verbatim}
   [y, m, n] = unique(x)
\end{verbatim}
such that \verb|y = x(m)| and \verb|x = y(n)|.  If the argument \verb|x| is a matrix,
you can also indicate that FreeMat should look for unique rows in the
matrix via
\begin{verbatim}
   y = unique(x,'rows')
\end{verbatim}
and
\begin{verbatim}
   [y, m, n] = unique(x,'rows')
\end{verbatim}
