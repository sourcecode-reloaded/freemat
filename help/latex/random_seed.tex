\section{SEED Seed the Random Number Generator}

\subsection{Usage}

Seeds the random number generator using the given integer seeds.  
Changing the seed allows you to choose which pseudo-random
sequence is generated.  The seed takes two \verb|uint32| values:
\begin{verbatim}
  seed(s,t)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|s| and \verb|t| are the seed values.  Note that due to limitations
in \verb|ranlib|, the values of \verb|s,t| must be between \verb|0 <= s,t <= 2^30|.
\subsection{Example}

Here's an example of how the seed value can be used to reproduce
a specific random number sequence.
