\section{IPERMUTE Array Inverse Permutation Function}

\subsection{Usage}

The \verb|ipermute| function rearranges the contents of an array according
to the inverse of the specified permutation vector.  The syntx for 
its use is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = ipermute(x,p)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|p| is a permutation vector - i.e., a vector containing the 
integers \verb|1...ndims(x)| each occuring exactly once.  The resulting
array \verb|y| contains the same data as the array \verb|x|, but ordered
according to the inverse of the given permutation.  This function and
the \verb|permute| function are inverses of each other.
\subsection{Example}

First we create a large multi-dimensional array, then permute it
 and then inverse permute it, to retrieve the original array:
