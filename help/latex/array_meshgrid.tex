\section{MESHGRID Generate Grid Mesh For Plots}

\subsection{Usage}

The \verb|meshgrid| function generates arrays that can be used for the
generation of surface plots.  The syntax is one of 
\begin{verbatim}
  [X,Y] = meshgrid(x)
  [X,Y] = meshgrid(x,y)
  [X,Y,Z] = meshgrid(x,y,z)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|x,y,z| are vectors, and \verb|X,Y,Z| are matrices.  In the first
case \verb|[X,Y] = meshgrid(x)|, the rows of \verb|X| and the columns of \verb|Y|
contain copies of the vector \verb|x|.  In the second case 
\verb|[X,Y] = meshgrid(x,y)|, the rows of \verb|X| contain copies of \verb|x|, and
the columns of \verb|Y| contain copies of \verb|y|.  In the third case, each
input is copied along the row, column or slice direction of the
corresponding output variable.
\subsection{Example}

In the first example:

Next, we use different vectors for \verb|X| and for \verb|Y|:
