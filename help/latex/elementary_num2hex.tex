\section{NUM2HEX Convert Numbers to IEEE Hex Strings}

\subsection{Usage}

Converts single and double precision arrays to IEEE hex strings.  The
syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = num2hex(x)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|x| is either a \verb|float| or \verb|double| array.  The output \verb|y| is
a \verb|n-by-p| character array, where \verb|n| is the number of elements in \verb|x|,
and \verb|p| is 16 for \verb|double| arrays, and 8 for \verb|single| arrays.
