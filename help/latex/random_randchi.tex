\section{RANDCHI Generate Chi-Square Random Variable}

\subsection{Usage}

Generates a vector of chi-square random variables with the
given number of degrees of freedom.  The general syntax for
its use is 
\begin{verbatim}
   y = randchi(n)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|n| is an array containing the degrees of freedom for
each generated random variable.
\subsection{Function Internals}

A chi-square random variable is essentially distributed as
the squared Euclidean norm of a vector of standard Gaussian random 
variables.  The number of degrees of freedom is generally the
number of elements in the vector.  In general, the PDF of
a chi-square random variable is
\[
 f(x) = \frac{x^{r/2-1}e^{-x/2}}{\Gamma(r/2)2^{r/2}}
\]

Here is an example of using \verb|randchi| and \verb|randn| to compute
some chi-square random variables with four degrees of freedom.
