\section{ISNAN Test for Not-a-Numbers}

\subsection{Usage}

Returns true for entries of an array that are NaN's (i.e.,
Not-a-Numbers).  The usage is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = isnan(x)
\end{verbatim}
The result is a logical array of the same size as \verb|x|,
which is true if \verb|x| is not-a-number, and false otherwise.
Note that for complex data types that
the result is true if either the real or imaginary parts
are NaNs.
\subsection{Example}

Suppose we have an array of floats with one element that
is \verb|nan|:
