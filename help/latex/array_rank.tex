\section{RANK Calculate the Rank of a Matrix}

\subsection{Usage}

Returns the rank of a matrix.  There are two ways to use
the \verb|rank| function is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = rank(A,tol)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|tol| is the tolerance to use when computing the
rank.  The second form is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = rank(A)
\end{verbatim}
in which case the tolerance \verb|tol| is chosen as
\begin{verbatim}
   tol = max(size(A))*max(s)*eps,
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|s| is the vector of singular values of \verb|A|.  The
rank is computed using the singular value decomposition \verb|svd|.
\subsection{Examples}

Here we construct an ill-conditioned matrix, and show the use 
of the \verb|tol| argument.
