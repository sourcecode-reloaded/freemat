\section{PERMUTE Array Permutation Function}

\subsection{Usage}

The \verb|permute| function rearranges the contents of an array according
to the specified permutation vector.  The syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
    y = permute(x,p)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|p| is a permutation vector - i.e., a vector containing the 
integers \verb|1...ndims(x)| each occuring exactly once.  The resulting
array \verb|y| contains the same data as the array \verb|x|, but ordered
according to the permutation.  This function is a generalization of
the matrix transpose operation.
\subsection{Example}

Here we use \verb|permute| to transpose a simple matrix (note that permute
also works for sparse matrices):

Now we permute a larger n-dimensional array:
