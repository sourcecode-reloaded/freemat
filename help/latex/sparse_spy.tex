\section{SPY Visualize Sparsity Pattern of a Sparse Matrix}

\subsection{Usage}

Plots the sparsity pattern of a sparse matrix.  The syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
   spy(x)
\end{verbatim}
which uses a default color and symbol.  Alternately, you can use
\begin{verbatim}
   spy(x,colspec)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|colspec| is any valid color and symbol spec accepted by \verb|plot|.
\subsection{Example}

First, an example of a random sparse matrix.

Here is a sparse matrix with a little more structure.  First we build a 
sparse matrix with block diagonal structure, and then use \verb|spy| to 
visualize the structure.
