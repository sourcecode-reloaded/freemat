\section{DOTTIMES Element-wise Multiplication Operator}

\subsection{Usage}

Multiplies two numerical arrays (elementwise).  There are two forms
for its use, both with the same general syntax:
\begin{verbatim}
  y = a .* b
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|a| and \verb|b| are \verb|n|-dimensional arrays of numerical type.  In the
first case, the two arguments are the same size, in which case, the 
output \verb|y| is the same size as the inputs, and is the element-wise
product of \verb|a| and \verb|b|.  In the second case, either \verb|a| or \verb|b| is a scalar, 
in which case \verb|y| is the same size as the larger argument,
and is the product of the scalar with each element of the other argument.


The rules for manipulating types has changed in FreeMat 4.0.  See \verb|typerules|
for more details.

\subsection{Function Internals}

There are three formulae for the dot-times operator, depending on the
sizes of the three arguments.  In the most general case, in which 
the two arguments are the same size, the output is computed via:
\[
y(m_1,\ldots,m_d) = a(m_1,\ldots,m_d) \times b(m_1,\ldots,m_d)
\]
If \verb|a| is a scalar, then the output is computed via
\[
y(m_1,\ldots,m_d) = a \times b(m_1,\ldots,m_d).
\]
On the other hand, if \verb|b| is a scalar, then the output is computed via
\[
y(m_1,\ldots,m_d) = a(m_1,\ldots,m_d) \times b.
\]
\subsection{Examples}

Here are some examples of using the dottimes operator.  First, a 
straight-forward usage of the \verb|.*| operator.  The first example
is straightforward:

Next, we multiply a scalar by a vector of values:

With complex values

Finally, the element-wise version:
