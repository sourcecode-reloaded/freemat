\section{ANGLE Phase Angle Function}

\subsection{Usage}

Compute the phase angle in radians of a complex matrix.  The general
syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
  p = angle(c)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|c| is an \verb|n|-dimensional array of numerical type.
\subsection{Function Internals}

For a complex number \verb|x|, its polar representation is
given by
\[
  x = |x| e^{j\theta}
\]
and we can compute 
\[
  \theta = \mathrm{atan2}(\Im x, \Re x)
\]
\subsection{Example}

Here are some examples of the use of \verb|angle| in the polar decomposition
of a complex number.
