\section{DEC2BIN Convert Decimal to Binary String}

\subsection{USAGE}

Converts an integer to a binary string.  The syntax for its
use is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = dec2bin(x,n)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|x| is the positive integer, and \verb|n| is the number of
bits to use in the representation.  Alternately, if you leave
\verb|n| unspecified, 
\begin{verbatim}
   y = dec2bin(x)
\end{verbatim}
the minimum number of bits needed to represent \verb|x| are used.
If \verb|x| is a vector, then the resulting \verb|y| is a character
matrix.
