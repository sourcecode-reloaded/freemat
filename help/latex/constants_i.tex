\section{I-J Square Root of Negative One}

\subsection{Usage}

Returns a \verb|complex| value that represents the square root of -1.  There are two
functions that return the same value:
\begin{verbatim}
   y = i
\end{verbatim}
and 
\begin{verbatim}
   y = j.
\end{verbatim}
This allows either \verb|i| or \verb|j| to be used as loop indices.  The returned value is a 32-bit complex value.
\subsection{Example}

The following examples demonstrate a few calculations with \verb|i|.

The same calculations with \verb|j|:

Here is an example of how \verb|i| can be used as a loop index and then recovered as the square root of -1.
