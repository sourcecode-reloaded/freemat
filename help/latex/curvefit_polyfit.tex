\section{POLYFIT Fit Polynomial To Data}

\subsection{Usage}

The \verb|polyfit| routine has the following syntax
\begin{verbatim}
  p = polyfit(x,y,n)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|x| and \verb|y| are vectors of the same size, and
\verb|n| is the degree of the approximating polynomial.  
The resulting vector \verb|p| forms the coefficients of
the optimal polynomial (in descending degree) that fit
\verb|y| with \verb|x|.  
\subsection{Function Internals}

The \verb|polyfit| routine finds the approximating polynomial
\[
   p(x) = p_1 x^n + p_2 x^{n-1} + \dots + p_n x + p_{n+1}
\]
such that
\[
   \sum_{i} (p(x_i) - y_i)^2
\]
is minimized.  It does so by forming the Vandermonde matrix
and solving the resulting set of equations using the backslash
operator.  Note that the Vandermonde matrix can become poorly
conditioned with large \verb|n| quite rapidly.
\subsection{Example}

A classic example from Edwards and Penny, consider the problem
of approximating a sinusoid with a polynomial.  We start with
a vector of points evenly spaced on the unit interval, along with
a vector of the sine of these points.

Next, we fit a third degree polynomial to the sine, and use
\verb|polyval| to plot it
