\section{DOUBLE Convert to 64-bit Floating Point}

\subsection{Usage}

Converts the argument to a 64-bit floating point number.  The syntax
for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = double(x)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|x| is an \verb|n|-dimensional numerical array.  Conversion follows the 
saturation rules.  Note that both \verb|NaN| and \verb|Inf| are both preserved under type conversion.
\subsection{Example}

The following piece of code demonstrates several uses of \verb|double|.  First, 
we convert from an integer (the argument is an integer because no decimal is present):
@>
In the next example, a single precision argument is passed in (the presence of 
the \verb|f| suffix implies single precision).
@>
In the next example, a complex argument is passed in.
@>
In the next example, a string argument is passed in.  The string argument 
is converted into an integer array corresponding to the ASCII values of each character.
@>
In the last example, a cell-array is passed in.  For cell-arrays 
and structure arrays, the result is an error.
