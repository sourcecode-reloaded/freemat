\section{FTELL File Position Function}

\subsection{Usage}

Returns the current file position for a valid file handle.
The general use of this function is
\begin{verbatim}
  n = ftell(handle)
\end{verbatim}
The \verb|handle| argument must be a valid and active file handle.  The
return is the offset into the file relative to the start of the
file (in bytes).
\subsection{Example}

Here is an example of using \verb|ftell| to determine the current file 
position.  We read 512 4-byte floats, which results in the file 
pointer being at position 512*4 = 2048.
