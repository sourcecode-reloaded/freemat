\section{CEIL Ceiling Function}

\subsection{Usage}

Computes the ceiling of an n-dimensional array elementwise.  The
ceiling of a number is defined as the smallest integer that is
larger than or equal to that number. The general syntax for its use
is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = ceil(x)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|x| is a multidimensional array of numerical type.  The \verb|ceil| 
function preserves the type of the argument.  So integer arguments 
are not modified, and \verb|float| arrays return \verb|float| arrays as 
outputs, and similarly for \verb|double| arrays.  The \verb|ceil| function 
is not defined for \verb|complex| or \verb|dcomplex| types.
\subsection{Example}

The following demonstrates the \verb|ceil| function applied to various
(numerical) arguments.  For integer arguments, the ceil function has
no effect:
@>
Next, we take the \verb|ceil| of a floating point value:
@>
Note that the return type is a \verb|float| also.  Finally, for a \verb|double|
type:
