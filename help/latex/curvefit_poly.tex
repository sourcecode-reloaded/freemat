\section{POLY Convert Roots To Polynomial Coefficients}

\subsection{Usage}

This function calculates the polynomial coefficients for given roots
\begin{verbatim}
    p = poly(r)
\end{verbatim}
when \verb|r| is a vector, is a vector whose elements are the coefficients 
of the polynomial whose roots are the elements of \verb|r|.  Alternately,
you can provide a matrix
\begin{verbatim}
    p = poly(A)
\end{verbatim}
when \verb|A| is an \verb|N x N| square matrix, is a row vector with 
\verb|N+1| elements which are the coefficients of the
characteristic polynomial, \verb|det(lambda*eye(size(A))-A)|.
