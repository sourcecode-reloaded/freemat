\section{FULL Convert Sparse Matrix to Full Matrix}

\subsection{Usage}

Converts a sparse matrix to a full matrix.  The syntax for
its use is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = full(x)
\end{verbatim}
The type of \verb|x| is preserved.  Be careful with the function.
As a general rule of thumb, if you can work with the \verb|full|
representation of a function, you probably do not need the
sparse representation.
\subsection{Example}

Here we convert a full matrix to a sparse one, and back again.
