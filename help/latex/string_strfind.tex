\section{STRFIND Find Substring in a String}

\subsection{Usage}

Searches through a string for a pattern, and returns the starting
positions of the pattern in an array.  There are two forms for 
the \verb|strfind| function.  The first is for single strings
\begin{verbatim}
   ndx = strfind(string, pattern)
\end{verbatim}
the resulting array \verb|ndx| contains the starting indices in \verb|string|
for the pattern \verb|pattern|.  The second form takes a cell array of 
strings
\begin{verbatim}
   ndx = strfind(cells, pattern)
\end{verbatim}
and applies the search operation to each string in the cell array.
\subsection{Example}

Here we apply \verb|strfind| to a simple string

Here we search over multiple strings contained in a cell array.
