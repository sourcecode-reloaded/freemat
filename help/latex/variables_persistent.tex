\section{PERSISTENT Persistent Variables}

\subsection{Usage}

Persistent variables are variables whose value persists between
calls to a function or script.  The general syntax for its
use is
\begin{verbatim}
   persistent variable1 variable2 ... variableN
\end{verbatim}
The \verb|persistent| statement must occur before the variable
is the tagged as persistent.
\subsection{Example}

Here is an example of a function that counts how many
times it has been called.
\begin{verbatim}
    count_calls.m
function count_calls
  persistent ccount
  if (~exist('ccount')) ccount = 0; end;
  ccount = ccount + 1;
  printf('Function has been called %d times\n',ccount);
\end{verbatim}
We now call the function several times:
\begin{verbatim}
--> for i=1:10; count_calls; end
Function has been called 11 times
Function has been called 12 times
Function has been called 13 times
Function has been called 14 times
Function has been called 15 times
Function has been called 16 times
Function has been called 17 times
Function has been called 18 times
Function has been called 19 times
Function has been called 20 times
\end{verbatim}
