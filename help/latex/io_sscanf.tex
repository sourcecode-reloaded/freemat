\section{SSCANF Formated String Input Function (C-Style)}

\subsection{Usage}

Reads values from a string.  The general syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
  [a1,...,an] = sscanf(text,format)
\end{verbatim}
Here \verb|format| is the format string, which is a string that
controls the format of the input.  Each value that is parsed
from the \verb|text| occupies one output slot.  See \verb|printf|
for a description of the format.
