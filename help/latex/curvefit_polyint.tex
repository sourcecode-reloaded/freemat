\section{POLYINT Polynomial Coefficient Integration}

\subsection{Usage}

 The polyint function returns the polynomial coefficients resulting
 from integration of polynomial p. The syntax for its use is either
\begin{verbatim}
 pint = polyint(p,k)
\end{verbatim}
 or, for a default \verb|k = 0|,
\begin{verbatim}
 pint = polyint(p);
\end{verbatim}
 where \verb|p| is a vector of polynomial coefficients assumed to be in
 decreasing degree and \verb|k| is the integration constant.
