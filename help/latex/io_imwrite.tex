\section{IMWRITE Write Matrix to Image File}

\subsection{Usage}

Write the image data from the matrix into a given file.  Note that
FreeMat's support for \verb|imwrite| is not complete.
You can write images in the \verb|jpg,png,xpm,ppm| and some other formats.
The syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
  imwrite(filename, A)
  imwrite(filename, A, map)
  imwrite(filename, A, map, alpha)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|filename| is the name of the file to write to.  The input array 
\verb|A| contains the image data (2D for gray or indexed, and 3D for color).  
If \verb|A| is an integer array (int8, uint8, int16, uint16, int32, uint32), 
the values of its elements should be within 0-255.  If \verb|A| is a 
floating-point array (float or double), the value of its elements should be 
within 0-1.  \verb|map| contains the colormap information (for indexed images),
and \verb|alpha| the alphamap (transparency).
