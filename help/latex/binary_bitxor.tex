\section{BITXOR Bitwise Boolean Exclusive-Or (XOR) Operation}

\subsection{Usage}

Performs a bitwise binary xor operation on the two arguments and
returns the result.  The syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = bitxor(a,b)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|a| and \verb|b| are multi-dimensional unsigned integer arrays.
The and operation is performed using 32 bit unsigned intermediates.  Note that if a
or b is a scalar, then each element of the other array is xor'ed with
 that scalar.  Otherwise the two arrays must match in size.
