\section{CUMSUM Cumulative Summation Function}

\subsection{Usage}

Computes the cumulative sum of an n-dimensional array along a given
dimension.  The general syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
  y = cumsum(x,d)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|x| is a multidimensional array of numerical type, and \verb|d|
is the dimension along which to perform the cumulative sum.  The
output \verb|y| is the same size of \verb|x|.  Integer types are promoted
to \verb|int32|. If the dimension \verb|d| is not specified, then the
cumulative sum is applied along the first non-singular dimension.
\subsection{Function Internals}

The output is computed via
\[
  y(m_1,\ldots,m_{d-1},j,m_{d+1},\ldots,m_{p}) = 
  \sum_{k=1}^{j} x(m_1,\ldots,m_{d-1},k,m_{d+1},\ldots,m_{p}).
\]
\subsection{Example}

The default action is to perform the cumulative sum along the
first non-singular dimension.
