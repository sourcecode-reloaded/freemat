Remaining issues in the array-rework branch:

1. captured function pointers -- Fixed (sort of)
2. JIT
3. KeyManager - cut?
4. Warn (Array.cpp) -- Fixed
5. Warn (Algorithms.cpp) -- Fixed
6. matrix concatenation of classes? -- Fixed
7. improved test cases
8  text output fine tuning -- Fixed

Workspace IDs?
If we have a function pointer class that contains a workspace, there is a problem with it's 
implementation at the moment.  When the function pointer is dereferenced:

t = @func;

t(3)

By right, t should not be changed by the call to "functionpointer:subsref".  However, t contains 
the workspace for the variables that are stored in it.  The only way to fix this problem is to 
either special case the functionpointer:subsref call (ugly), or have the functionpointer store 
a reference to a workspace (instead of the workspace itself).  I will have to use the later 
approach, although it introduces an additional level of complexity to the functionpointer class.
