Build Instructions

Starting with version 4.0, FreeMat is fairly straightforward to build.  With a couple of 
notable exceptions, all of the dependencies needed to build a complete version of FreeMat
are bundled with the source code.  The exceptions are QT, CMake and FFTW, both of which are
far to complex to embed within the FreeMat build tree.  So the build procedure is essentially:
   - Install Qt 4.5
   - Install FFTW
   - Install CMake
   - Download the FreeMat source code
   - Configure the source using CMake (there are tutorials on how to use CMake available on the WWW)
   - Build FreeMat, which will automatically build all of the necessary dependencies.
   - Install FreeMat
The procedure is essentially the same on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows, but for completeness, each OS is
described in a little more detail below.


Linux

- Install Qt 4.5 (http://www.qtsoftware.com/downloads)
- Install fftw and fftwf from http://www.fftw.org
    - wget http://www.fftw.org/fftw-3.2.2.tar.gz
    - tar xvfz fftw-3.2.2.tar.gz
    - cd fftw-3.2.2
    - mkdir build_fftw
    - cd build_fftw
    - ../configure
    - make && sudo make install
    - cd ..
    - mkdir build_fftwf
    - cd build_fftwf
    - ../configure --enable-single
    - make && make install
- Install CMake (version 2.6.4 or later) for Mac OS X from http://www.cmake.org
- Download the FreeMat source package
- Unpack the source package
- Run ccmake from the build directory
	(it is strongly suggested that the build directory should be outside the source tree.)
- configure and generate the makefiles
- Build FreeMat via "make"

Mac OS X

- Install Developer Tools
- Install Qt 4.5 (the prebuilt version for Cocoa works fine)
- Install fftw and fftwf into /usr/local - we build these in two seperate directories 
    - wget http://www.fftw.org/fftw-3.2.2.tar.gz
    - tar xvfz fftw-3.2.2.tar.gz
    - cd fftw-3.2.2
    - mkdir build_fftw
    - cd build_fftw
    - ../configure
    - make && sudo make install
    - cd ..
    - mkdir build_fftwf
    - cd build_fftwf
    - ../configure --enable-single
    - make && make install
- Install CMake (version 2.6.4 or later) for Mac OS X from http://www.cmake.org
- Download the FreeMat source package
- Unpack the source package
- Run CMake (or CMakeSetup.exe)  Select the build type you want (e.g., makefiles).
- Enter path to <CMake source> in cmake source directory edit box. Enter path to build directory
	(it is strongly suggested that the build directory should be outside the source tree.)
- Click Configure button. 
- Press "Ok" to generate the makefiles.
- Build FreeMat via "make"


Windows / Visual Studio Express / CMake

- Install Visual C++ 2008 Express
- Install CMake (version 2.6.4 or later) for Win32 from http://www.cmake.org
- If optimized BLAS libraries are available (vendor or ATLAS BLAS) install those.
- Install Qt 4.5
    - Download the source package from http://download.qtsoftware.com/qt/source/qt-win-opensource-src-4.5.0.zip
    - Unpack the source code into, e.g. c:\qt
    - Open the Visual Studio Command prompt, and cd to this directory
    - Configure QT with "configure"
    - make QT with "nmake"
- Download the FreeMat source package
- Unpack the source package
- Run CMake (or CMakeSetup.exe)  Select the build type that corresponds to your version of Visual Studio.
- Enter path to <CMake source> in cmake source directory edit box. Enter path to build directory
	(it is strongly suggested that the build directory should be outside the source tree.)
- Click Configure button. 
- Press "Ok" to generate VS solution files.
- Open FreeMat.sln from the build directory
- Build FreeMat
