Manual check:

In this branch, I need to fix:

1.  The performance of the "image" and plot commands - done
2.  The zoom feature - done
3.  Image zoom and translation behaving strangely. - done
4.  Add a measurement tool?


inf * (0+i) = 0 + inf*i

inf * (1+i) = inf + inf*i


(1+inf*i) * (1)   = 1 + inf*i
(1+inf*i) * (inf) = inf + inf*i
(1+inf*i) * (0)   = 0 + nan*i

 -- Installation instructions need to be rewritten

-- How do we want the tests to look:

Something like:

function test_val = wbtest_abs_1
  % Load the set of input test matrices
  load wbinputs.mat
  % Load the reference vector for this test
  load reference/wbtest_abs_1_ref.mat
  fail_count = 0;
  for i=1:numel(wbinputs)
    x1 = wbinputs{i};
    error_flag = 0;
    try
      y1=abs(x1);
    catch 
      error_flag = 1;
    end
    if (~test_near(y1,y1_refs{i}))
      printf('Mismatch (norm): %d y1=abs(x1)\n',i);
      fail_count = fail_count+1;
    end
  end
  test_val = (fail_count == 0);
end


Also we would need a script that generates the reference matrix.  For example:

function wbgen_abs_1
  % Load the set of input test matrices
  load wbinputs.mat
  n = numel(wbinputs);
  error_refs = zeros(n,1);
  y1_refs = cell(n,1);
  np = 1;
  for i=1:numel(wbinputs)
    x1 = wbinputs{i};
    try
      y1_refs{np} = abs(x1);
    catch
      error_refs(np) = 1;
    end
    np = np + 1;
  end
  save wbtest_abs_1_ref.mat y1_refs error_refs
