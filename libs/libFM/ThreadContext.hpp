// The context struct is meant to contain (pointers) to all objects needed by the execution
// of the FM code.  Because of the new design of the array classes (and their lack of 
// thread safe reference counting), each VM which operates in a thread must have access
// to it's own context.  All object pools are then allocated with respect to the current
// context.  Sharing variables will be need to be addressed later.  The toolchain is also
// connected to the context, although it's not clear this is strictly necessary.  For sure
// different threads will need their own compilers and VM objects, and the ability to
// inject code at run time means that functions need access to a compiler (consider the
// eval statement).
