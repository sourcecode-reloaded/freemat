Helpgen is able to parse *.m and *.cpp files and detect "magic" comment format specifiers. The "magic" comments are then converted into documentation, sanity tests and separate regression test scripts. 

Format of the comments that are processed by helpgen.

Documentation block: delimits the start and end of the "magic" comment block.
The documentation block begins and ends with comment string that starts with exclamation point character "!".

Example:
Matlab:
%!
%@Module INTRODUCTION This is a doc block.
%!

C/C++:
//!
//@Module INTRODUCTION This is a doc block.
//!

Module Name: subsection name. 
For a function module name would be the function name. Module name starts with "@Module" followed by module name and description.

Example:
Matlab:
%@Module IMAGE Image Display Function

C/C++:
//@Module IMAGE Image Display Function

Section Name: name of the help section where the module help will be placed. 
Possible section names are listed in file "section_descriptors.txt" (if you are adding a new section name you have to edit that file). Section name starts with "@@Section" followed by the section name.

Example:
Matlab:
%@@Section HANDLE

C/C++:
//@@Section HANDLE

Usage section: text that you want to go into help document.
Usage section starts with "@@Usage"
